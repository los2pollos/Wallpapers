# Wallpapers
I use this repository for quickly getting all of them quickly whenever setting up a new Linux Desktop.
Just clone the repo on the new environment and it's done!

### Acknowledgments
I'm greatly thankful to https://gitlab.com/dwt1/

### Note to self
1. Use the renaming script to ensure consistency
2. If you're experiencing troubles with <code>git push</code> for new wallpapers, just use SSH instead of HTTPS
3. Enjoy!
